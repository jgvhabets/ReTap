    Detect the moments of finger-raising and -lowering

    Function detects the axis with most variation and then
    first detects several large/small pos/neg peaks, then
    the function determines sample-wise in which part of a
    movement or tap the acc-timeseries is, and defines the
    exact moments of finger-raising, finger-lowering, and
    the in between stopping moments.
